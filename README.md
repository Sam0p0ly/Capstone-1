In this capstone I was informed: 
"You're consulting as a data analyst for Lariat. They've hired you to make suggestions on how to make smarter business decisions. Your job is to analyze the costs and revenue generated by their rental car fleet.
They've provided you with raw data in four Excel workbooks. Based on this raw data and their business objective, Lariat has asked you to produce the following deliverables:
An Excel model that they can use to make data-informed decisions about their fleet. This should be based on their observed cost and revenue data in recent years. 
A PowerPoint deck that provides an analysis of the problem, along with your suggestions.
A live presentation in which you share your findings with a Lariat executive."
